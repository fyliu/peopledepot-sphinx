# HfLA Keep meeting agendas as Github issues

* Status: proposed
* Date: 2023-02-06

## Context and Problem Statement

There's a question about why we use a Github issue for meeting agendas rather than have them as wiki pages.

## Considered Options

* Github issue
* wiki

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Github issue", because Hack for LA has automations that can make use of the agendas in the issues.
